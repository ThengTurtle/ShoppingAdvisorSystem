* Installing the Sample Databases
---------------------------------
These examples use two sample databases: Northwind and Pubs.

To install the sample databases, you can use the following SQL scripts:

- Use InstNwnd.sql to install the Northwind database.
- Use InstPubs.sql to install the Pubs database.

If you are using a full version of SQL Server, you can open these scripts and run
them using a graphical tool like SQL Server Management Studio, or you can use
sqlcmd.exe, which is discussed below.

If you are using SQL Server Express, you need to use the sqlcmd.exe command-line
tool. For example, you can use a command like this to install the Northwind
database on SQL Server Express LocalDB:

  sqlcmd -S (localdb)\v11.0 -i InstNwnd.sql

Or on the separately downloadable version of SQL Server Express:

  sqlcmd -S localhost\SQLEXPRESS -i InstNwnd.sql

If you are using a full version of SQL Server on the local computer, you need
a command like this:

  sqlcmd -i InstNwnd.sql
